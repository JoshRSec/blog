Welcome to my corner of the digital world! I'm Joshua Robbins, and I'm thrilled to give you a glimpse into my professional journey, passions, and interests.
## **Professional Background**

I currently work as an Senior IT Security Analyst, where my role revolves around safeguarding systems, users and customers.

My responsibilities include:

 	* Incident Response, handling and mitigating security incidents.
 	* Event Monitoring and Analysis.
 	* Vulnerability Management.


Before my venture into IT security, I wore the hat of an Infrastructure Engineer. During this chapter of my career, I undertook and completed diverse infrastructure projects, each a puzzle I enjoyed solving. As a 2nd/3rd line incident infrastructure support resource, I learned the art of rapid problem-solving. I was the bridge between challenges and solutions, presenting problems to the infrastructure team and guiding them towards effective resolutions. My role also included the administration of systems, mainly Windows environments, and I ensured compliance with established standards such as ISO 27001 by conducting internal audits and maintaining policies.
## **Education and Expertise**

My educational foundation includes a BSc in Computer Science, a journey that instilled in me the core principles of this ever-evolving field. In addition to my formal education, I hold industry-recognized certifications, including CompTIA Security+ and Azure Administrator AZ-104.
## **Passions and Hobbies**

Beyond my professional life, I'm a passionate enthusiast of technology and security. My home lab is my playground where I experiment with new concepts, tinker with different setups, and continually expand my knowledge. I find joy in dissecting emerging security trends and staying ahead of potential threats – it's a dynamic field that keeps me on my toes.

While the digital realm is my primary domain, I also have a deep appreciation for the natural world. Hiking across the picturesque landscapes of the UK is my way of unwinding.
## **Join Me on This Journey**
